**Constraints & Considerations:**
* **Modularity:** Design AI functions to be modular (e.g., separate functions for resume parsing, job description analysis, resume generation, cover letter generation).
* **Efficiency:** Optimize for speed, especially for document generation.
* **Accuracy:** Strive for high accuracy in information extraction and ATS keyword identification.
* **Ethical AI:** Ensure responsible data handling3. Avoid generating misleading information.
* **User Feedback:** Incorporate mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the generated documents and suggestions.
* **Code Structure:** Adhere to the constraint of no file having more than 500 lines of code. This implies breaking down complex AI logic into smaller, manageable modules/services.
* **Deployment:** Keep in mind the application will be deployed on Netlify (free plan) or Replit, which may have limitations on execution time and resources for serverless functions. Design AI processes to be efficient.

**Tone and Style of AI Responses (for direct user interaction, if any, beyond document generation):**
* Professional, supportive, and action-oriented.
* Clear and concise language.
* Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it if necessary.
