## Usage Guidelines

### Model Recommendations
- **Primary:** OpenRouter with Claude or GPT models for complex parsing tasks
- **Secondary:** Gemini 2.5 Pro for backup/alternative processing
- **Fallback:** Local processing with basic extraction if AI services fail

### Error Handling
- All prompts include JSON validation requirements
- Implement fallback parsing for malformed responses
- Log parsing failures for prompt optimization
- Provide basic extracted data if structured parsing fails

### Optimization Tips
- Include examples in prompts for complex formatting requirements
- Use consistent field naming across all parsing tasks
- Implement post-processing normalization for critical fields (like skills)
- Monitor token usage and optimize prompt length as needed

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize all input data before sending to AI models
- Never include sensitive information in prompts
- Implement rate limiting for AI API calls
- Validate all JSON responses before processing
