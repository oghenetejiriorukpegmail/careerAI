# Authentication Fix: Resolving Login Redirect Loop

## Problem

A login redirect loop was occurring where:
1. Authenticated users were being redirected back to login page
2. The middleware was not correctly checking authentication state
3. Login and session handling was not properly implemented

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Middleware Authentication Check

Updated the middleware to:
- Check if user is already authenticated when accessing the login page
- Redirect authenticated users to dashboard when they try to access login page
- Prevent redirect loops by properly handling authentication state

```typescript
// For login page, check if user is already authenticated
if (request.nextUrl.pathname === '/login') {
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (session) {
    // User is already logged in, redirect to dashboard
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url));
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Login Page with Session Check

Added client-side session verification in the login page:
- Checks authentication state on page load
- Shows loading state while checking
- Redirects to dashboard if user is already authenticated
- Prevents unnecessary login attempts

```typescript
// Check if user is already logged in
useEffect(() => {
  const checkSession = async () => {
    try {
      const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
      
      // If user is already logged in, redirect to dashboard
      if (data.session) {
        console.log('User already logged in, redirecting to dashboard');
        window.location.href = '/dashboard';
        return;
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error checking session:', err);
    } finally {
      setPageLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  checkSession();
}, []);
```

### 3. Improved Login Success Handling

Updated the login success handler to:
- Add safety checks to prevent redirect loops
- Add a small delay for session registration
- Properly handle redirect parameters

```typescript
// Safety check to prevent redirect loops
const safeRedirectTo = redirectTo && 
                      !redirectTo.includes('/login') && 
                      !redirectTo.includes('/signup') 
                      ? redirectTo 
                      : '/dashboard';

// Wait a moment for the session to be properly registered
setTimeout(() => {
  // Use window.location for a hard redirect
  window.location.href = safeRedirectTo;
}, 500);
```

### 4. Added Debug Authentication Page

Created a new debug page at `/debug-auth` that:
- Shows current authentication state
- Displays session details
- Provides options to refresh session data or log out
- Helps with troubleshooting authentication issues

## Results

- Authenticated users stay logged in and can access protected routes
- Login page correctly redirects authenticated users to dashboard
- Unauthenticated users are properly redirected to login
- No more redirect loops between login and dashboard
- Improved user experience with clear authentication state
