# Authentication System Fix: Resolving Redirect Loops

## Problem

The authentication system was experiencing redirect loops between login and dashboard pages. The following issues were causing this:

1. The middleware had complex logic for handling authentication checks
2. Multiple redirects were occurring between pages
3. Session checks in both middleware and client components were creating conflicts

## Solution

### 1. Simplified Middleware Logic

The middleware has been streamlined to focus only on critical protected routes:

```typescript
// Allow all non-dashboard, non-API routes to pass through
if (!request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard') && 
    !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/api/')) {
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### 2. Selective Redirects

Redirect logic has been improved to:
- Only redirect from protected dashboard and API routes to login
- Add redirectTo parameters only for dashboard routes (not API routes)
- Use direct redirects instead of timeout-based redirects

```typescript
// If it's a dashboard or protected API route and user is not authenticated
if ((isDashboardRoute || isProtectedRoute) && !session) {
  console.log(`Unauthenticated access attempt to protected route: ${request.nextUrl.pathname}`);
  
  // Set up login URL with redirect
  const loginUrl = new URL('/login', request.url);
  
  // Don't add redirectTo if it's a complex API route to prevent potential issues
  if (isDashboardRoute) {
    loginUrl.searchParams.set('redirectTo', request.nextUrl.pathname);
  }
  
  return NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl);
}
```

### 3. Improved Login Page

The login page has been updated to:
- Not perform automatic redirects on session detection
- Simplify session checks to avoid conflicts with middleware
- Handle login success with direct redirects

```typescript
// Simple session check without auto-redirect (to prevent loops)
useEffect(() => {
  const checkSession = async () => {
    try {
      const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
      console.log('Session check on login page:', data.session ? 'Authenticated' : 'Not authenticated');
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error checking session:', err);
    } finally {
      setPageLoading(false);
    }
  };
  
  checkSession();
}, []);
```

### 4. Simplified Configuration

The middleware configuration now only targets the specific routes that need protection:

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Protected API routes
    '/api/settings',
    '/api/settings/:path*',
    '/api/documents/:path*',
    '/api/parse-resume',
    '/api/resumeupload',
    // Protect all dashboard pages
    '/dashboard',
    '/dashboard/:path*'
  ],
};
```

## Result

- No more redirect loops
- Clean authentication flow
- Protected routes consistently require authentication
- Login process works reliably
- Better user experience without constant redirects
- Simpler and more maintainable code
